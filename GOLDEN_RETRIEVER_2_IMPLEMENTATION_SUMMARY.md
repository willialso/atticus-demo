## 🚀 Ready to Use

### API Endpoint
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/gr2/chat
```

### Example Request
```json
{
  "message": "What does Delta mean?",
  "screen_state": {
    "current_btc_price": 105000.0,
    "selected_option_type": "call",
    "selected_strike": 105000.0,
    "selected_expiry": 240,
    "visible_strikes": [104000, 104500, 105000, 105500, 106000],
    "active_tab": "options_chain"
  }
}
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on your question about 'What does Delta mean?' and the current context (Selected option type: call; Selected strike: $105,000; Current BTC price: $105,000; Active tab: options_chain), here's what you need to know:\n\nDelta shows how much the option price is expected to move for a $1 move in BTC. For calls, delta ranges from 0 to 1. For puts, delta ranges from -1 to 0. ATM options have delta around 0.5 for calls and -0.5 for puts.",
  "sources": ["Delta", "Theta", "Option Types"],
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "jargon_terms": ["delta"],
  "context_used": "Selected option type: call; Selected strike: $105,000; Current BTC price: $105,000; Active tab: options_chain"
}
```
